# Bon Ã©tat - a finite state machine.

A finite state machine that uses code generation.

## Usage
The following creates a finite state machine that defines a turnstile:

```js
var FSM = require('bon-etat');

// define a state machine like this:
var Turnstile = FSM({
    locked: {
        coin: 'unlocked',
        push: 'locked'
    },
    unlocked: {
        push: 'locked',
        coin: 'unlocked'
    }
});
// and create instances of this state machine like this:
var turnstile = new Turnstile();
var turnstile2 = new Turnstile('unlocked'); // initialized in unlocked state
```

It is now possible to send events to the state machine (`.change`), and ask for its state (`.state`), like this:

```js
console.log(turnstile.state); // 'locked'
turnstile.change('push');
console.log(turnstile.state); // 'locked'
turnstile.change('coin');
console.log(turnstile.state); // 'unlocked'
turnstile.change('push');
console.log(turnstile.state); // 'locked'
```

Notice, unless the state is passed in as the argument to the state machine instance, the initial state will be the first defined state passed in the state machine definition. That is why the `turnstile` is in the *locked* state upon initialization.


### Emitted transition events
The following events are emitted when the state machine changes state:

  * `update` *`function(from, to)`*, whenever the state machine receive an update command. This will get triggered even if the state stays the same.
  * `goingFromAToB` *`function(from, to)`*, when ever the state transitions from a state to another. These events are auto generated based on the state names, so in the turnstile example from the previous section, the transition from *locked -> unlocked* would emit *`goingFromLockedToUnlocked`*.
  * `leavingA` *`function(to)`* whenever the state machine leaves a given state. These are auto generated from the state names, so if the current state is *locked* the event *`leavingLocked`* would be emitted.
  * `enteringA` *`function(from)`*, same as leavingA, but triggers when the state changes into the given state.

Example:
```js
// using the turnstile from the previous section
turnstile.on('leavingLocked', function(to) {
    console.log('Leaving locked state to:', to);
})
turnstile.change('coin');
// 'Leaving locked state to: unlocked'
```

The following events will get emitted if a state update causes the state machine to stay in its current state:

  * `staying` *`function(state)`* the state did not change.
  * `stayingInA` *`function()`* the state of a specific state remained the same. ie. staying in the locked state would emit `stayingInLocked`.

Only the update event will emit on all update-events.
